        <h1>Hunger Games and Problem Sets</h1>
        <p>To synthesize content from class with problem solving, every Friday, we will solve a non-routine problem together in groups on white boards using a Hunger Games Protocol. This is a modified Socratic Seminar or Fishbowl protocol that is often used in Humanities classes.</p>

          <h2>Problem Sets</h2>
          <p>On Monday, this problem is distributed as the Problem Set for the week. Students must write or type up a solution to either Problem A, the Hunger Games problem from Friday, or a similar but more difficult Problem B and submit the writeup on Friday. Problem Sets are graded on a rubric for three areas: Problem Solving, Math Fluency, and Reasoning & Proof.</p>
          <p>Because some students may require more time to process and understand the problem than given in class, since Spring 2018, I have started posting walkthroughs to my problem sets. These are posted in Google Classroom on the date of the problem set's release. There are neither walkthroughs or solutions to the more difficult Problem Bs.</p>
