Project 0: Personal Website On Course Assigmment Policies and Philosophies

# Content
I decided to make a website summarizing the policies for my classroom, which I typically condense into a syllabus. However, as I am mentoring new teachers this summer, I find it helpful to write my justifications for my non-traditional policies in the event that I cannot have these conversations with pre-service teachers in person. The website for this project begins to collect my ideas all in one place. However, in the interest of time to finish this project, I had to stop putting in so much content and work on the styling of the pages!

Because my policies have been influenced by lots of reading over the past four years, I am missing minute citations in some areas (mostly because I am having difficulty remembering which blogs and people I got which ideas from). I am submitting this project after completing the minimum implementation requirements, with the hope that I can go back and flesh out this site's content in the next few months as the pedagogical conversations from my past come flooding back to me.

# Styling
I used Bootstrap to format my main four pages. I used my own stylesheet to format my side projects page.
