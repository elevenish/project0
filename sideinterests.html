            <p>I am involved in a number of <span id=emphasis>side projects</span>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class=projectname>Play With Your Math</li>
                <p class=math>I believe that math is fun first. With my former colleague, Joey Kelly, we co-curate and design math poster problems that encourage students to play with their math.</p>
                <li class=projectname>After The Dance</li>
                <p class=dance>I did technical direction for a project film called After The Dance by Jun Shepard (currently seeking music rights).</p>
                <li class=projectname>Lincoln Douglas Debate</li>
                <p class=extracurricular>I coach my high school's Lincoln Douglas debate team.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, I am interested in mathematical modeling and finding ways to teach modeling outside the traditional textbook problems that encourage "fake-world" math.</p>
