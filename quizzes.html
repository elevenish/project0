        <h1>Performance Based Assessment and Reassessment of Learning Objectives (PARLO)</h1>
        <p>In lieu of traditional "tests," I give weekly quizzes that allow students to demonstrate competency on the objectives of the class.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The quiz is no longer than the front side of an 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper.</li>
        <li>Each PARLO quiz tests one topic and has no more than five questions, worth a total of 5 points.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Students who score a 1, 2, or 3 have the opportunity to retake the quiz before the end of the grading period for the full points back on the quiz.</li>
        <li>Students who receive a 4 or 4.5 may submit a quiz revision to get a perfect 5 by writing their own similar problem and solving that one correctly.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If 60% of the class scores a 4 or higher, I know that I can move on to the next topic. If less than 60%, I go back and reteach the topic, and a retake of that quiz is printed on the back of the next week's quiz.</li>
        <li>Students may retake quizzes an infinite number of times before or after school before the end of a grading period. Prior to being given a retake, students must come in with their old quiz completely marked up with the correct answers to indicate that they've "learned" and "grown" from the experience.</li>
        <li>To discourage cheating, I provide a different version of the quiz to neighboring test takers and make public in class that I am doing this. Despite, this has lead me to catch a record-number of cheaters every year.</li>
        </ul>
