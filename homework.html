              <p>In lieu of daily homework, I sporadically give Homework Sandwiches to have students practice discrete skills in the form of exercises at home.</p>

                  <p>Homework Sandwich Protocol</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>Do one exercise.</li>
                  <li>Check your answer:</li>
                  <ul><li>If correct on the first try, give yourself 2 stars in a different colored pen.</li>
                  <li>If incorrect on the first try, use a different colored pen to fix your mistake, and then give yourself 1 star.</li>
                  <li>If incorrect, and you can't figure out why, or if you can't figure out how to start the problem at all, put a question mark.</li></ul>
                  <li>Repeat until you hit one of two benchmarks:</li>
                  <ul><li>Stop doing homework once you receive 10 stars. This means that you've learned how to do these types of problems. Making you do more would be wasting your time and mine.</li>
                  <li>Stop doing homework once you've accumulated 3 question marks. This means you need to go get help from a tutor, classmate (not by copying), or teacher.</li></ul>
                  <li>Turn in your homework.</li>
                  <ul><li>Correctly following the protocol and earning 10 stars is worth 5/5.</li>
                  <li>Correctly following the protocol and stopping at 3 question marks is worth an NY, which doesn't count against you until the marking period ends.</li>
                  <li>Any NYs must be revised before the end of the marking period, and are eligible for a full 5/5.</li>
                  <li>Any NYs not revised by the end of the marking period will change into a 1/5.</li></ul></ol>

                  <p>Problems Created By Traditional Daily Homework Exercises</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Only students who already know how to do most of the problems complete daily homework exercises.</li>
                  <li>Students who don't know how to do the exercises either don't do the homework or copy off their friends' homeworks during homeroom.</li>
                  <li>Too much time is wasted in class going over the previous night's homework.</li>
                  <li>Students run the risk coming in with completed homework that is all wrong.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Why Homework Sandwich Solves These Problems</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Answers are printed on the same page that they are assigned. Students do one exercise at a time and check their answers.</li>
                  <li>Once a certain number of correct answers has been obtained, students may stop doing the homework, and its submission will be considered complete.</li>
                  <li>If a student doesn't know how to even start the first three problems, they write question marks and turn in the blank homework as is. This goes in as a NY “not yet” in the gradebook, and the student must seek help before the end of the quarter to learn to do the homework and receive the full points back. Any remaining NYs at the end of the quarter turn into 1 out of 5s.</li>
